This Android mobile app helps users wheel numbers in various combinations to play the NC Lottery Pick 5 game.

## ABOUT LOTTERY WHEELING
Lottery wheeling is a strategy that allows players to select a range of numbers and combine them in such a way
that, if a certain subset of their numbers appear in the winning lottery numbers, they are guaranteed a lottery win.
The guaranteed wins are determined by number of digits played, number of combinations created, and type of win.
This strategy is most effective for pick 5 games that have a small number field.

## ABOUT THIS APP
This app is built upon the Smart Luck lottery wheeling strategy published by Gail Howard [(smartluck.com)](<https://www.smartluck.com/>).
As a portfolio project, it only includes a small subset of the published wheel combinations and is adapted for the NC Cash 5 lottery in
which 5 numbers are drawn from numbers 1-43, inclusive. This app is purely for practice and is not intended for commercial use.
